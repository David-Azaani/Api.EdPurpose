How make and use service!
Interface , implement , dependency, useing!


program :

// builder.Services.AddTransient<LocalMailService>(); // with out interface : not recomended
ctor(LocalMailService , xxx)

#if DEBUG
builder.Services.AddTransient<IMailService, LocalMailService>(); //just this if we dont want the next!! ;-)
#else 
builder.Services.AddTransient<IMailService, CloudMailService>();
#endif


in conroller 

ctor(ILocalMailService , xxx)
 _localMailService.Send(
               "Point of interest deleted.",
               $"Point of interest {poi.Name} with id {poi.Id} was deleted.");

Transient services // are created each time per requested : best for lightweight services and stateless services
Scoe services // once per  requested 
Singletone services // first time when we requested 



in fact with Local... without interface we have a concrete classe without being able to change !
but with having interface we have being able to change!


So now we cn change our static db to singleton

regisre it in program
inject in controller
and use!


for using static class just 
commend this builder.Services.AddSingleton<CitiesDataStore>(); 
and remove injection from all controllers and change source of data in each action!
